// ordinal.go maps sparse proto field numbers onto the dense, 0-based slots every
// target format actually uses.
//
// # Why a mapping is needed at all
//
// A proto field number is 1-based, may be any value up to 536,870,911, and is
// routinely sparse — deleting a field leaves a hole and adding one appends past
// the end. Cap'n Proto ordinals are 0-based and contiguous: a struct with N
// fields uses exactly 0..N-1, and the compiler rejects anything else. FlatBuffers
// ids are the same shape. So a target cannot simply write the proto number, and
// every target needs the same mapping — which is why it is computed once here
// rather than three times in three renderers that would eventually disagree.
//
// # Why it must be stable, and what makes it so
//
// The mapping is a wire format. A consumer that compiled against a schema where
// `rate_hz` was ordinal 5 will read slot 5 forever; if a later build moves
// `rate_hz` to 4 and puts something else at 5, that consumer silently reads the
// wrong field with no error at any layer. Nothing in proto, Cap'n Proto or
// FlatBuffers detects it.
//
// So the derivation is defined to be append-stable, and a deleted field is
// required to be `reserved`:
//
//	message Sensor {          // fields 1,2,3,4,5,7 with `reserved 6;`
//	  ...                     // ordinals    0,1,2,3,4,6, and 5 held by the
//	}                         // reserved slot so field 7 does not move
//
// Without the `reserved 6;`, field 7 would derive ordinal 5 — the slot the
// deleted field used to own — and every deployed consumer would misread it. That
// is why an unreserved gap is a RuleOrdinal diagnostic rather than a silent
// renumber, and why a repository with published schemas should run with
// `strict=ordinal:error`.
//
// # Why derivation is still not enough
//
// Derivation reconstructs history from what the .proto says today, and a .proto
// only remembers a deletion if someone wrote `reserved`. buffers.lock is the
// ledger that does not depend on anyone remembering: it records the ordinal each
// field was actually assigned, and a later build that would assign a different
// one reports the disagreement instead of shipping it. See lock.go.
//
// Precedence is: an explicit ordinal pin from the vocabulary, then the ledger,
// then derivation. A pin outranks the ledger deliberately — it is the escape
// hatch for adopting a schema that predates the generator, which is exactly the
// case the ledger cannot know about — but a pin that contradicts the ledger is
// reported, because the ledger's whole job is to notice a slot moving.

// maxOrdinalSpace bounds how many slots one message may occupy.
//
// The bound exists because reserved-range expansion is driven by numbers a proto
// author chose, and `reserved 1000 to max;` is a perfectly ordinary way to fence
// off a range. Expanding that literally would mint half a billion placeholder
// slots. Past this bound the build stops expanding, says so, and derives from the
// live fields alone — still deterministic, just no longer able to reconstruct
// deletions on its own, which is what the ledger is for.
