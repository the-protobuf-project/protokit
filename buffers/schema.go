	// Namespace is the FlatBuffers namespace and the Cap'n Proto C++ namespace.

	Namespace string

	// ROSPackage is the ROS 2 package the .msg/.srv files belong to. Defaults to
	// the proto package flattened with underscores.

	// JVMPackage is the Kotlin/Java package Wire generates into. Defaults to the
	// file's java_package, then to Package.
	JVMPackage string

	// GoImport is the Go import path from the file's own `option go_package`,
	// with any ";alias" suffix removed. Empty when the file declares none.
	//
	// It is read rather than re-declared because capnpc-go's $Go.import means
	// exactly what go_package already means, and asking an author to state the

	// run does not emit them and the module that does owns those decisions.

	// Imports are the proto paths this file imports that actually contribute a
