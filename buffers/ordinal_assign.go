// what derivation computes, what the ledger remembers, and what an author pinned.
//
// The derivation in ordinal.go knows about none of them — it maps numbers to
// positions and stops. Precedence is applied here, and a disagreement between the
// three becomes a diagnostic rather than a silent choice.
