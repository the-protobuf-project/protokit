# Every field, enum value and method this plugin has assigned a target slot to is
# recorded here by its proto field number. A later build that would assign a
# different slot reports the disagreement instead of shipping it.
#
# That matters because the slot is a wire format. A consumer compiled against a
# schema where a field sat at ordinal 5 reads ordinal 5 forever, and if a rebuild
# moves something else there, nothing — not protoc, not capnp, not flatc, not the
# consumer — reports an error. It just reads the wrong field.
#
# Do not edit by hand, and do not resolve a merge conflict in this file textually.
# A conflict here means two branches each assigned a slot; deciding which one wins
# is a compatibility decision, so .gitattributes marks the file -merge to keep git
# from guessing.
