// layout.go decides which messages are packed records and which are evolvable
// ones, and rejects a packed layout that cannot be honoured.
//
// The eligibility rules are FlatBuffers' rules for a `struct`, because that is
// the strictest of the targets: a struct is a fixed-size inline blob, so every
// field must have a size known at schema time and no field may be absent. Cap'n
// Proto's data section is more forgiving, but a message that qualifies here
// qualifies everywhere, and one set of rules beats three.
//
// A message that *asks* for LAYOUT_STRUCT and does not qualify is an error naming
// the field that disqualified it. Quietly downgrading it to a table would produce
// a schema that compiles and misses the entire point of the request — the caller
// wanted a memory layout, not a set of fields.

// resolveLayouts assigns every message a concrete layout.
//
// Every message is resolved, imported ones included, because a generated schema
// has to know whether an imported message is a packed record before it can
// reference it. Only generated messages are *reported* on: a dependency that asks
// for a layout it cannot have is its own module's problem to fix.
//
// Messages are visited in sorted node order so that the diagnostics come out the
// same way on every run; the memo makes the traversal order irrelevant to the
// result, but not to the reporting.
